KDE5 Wallet password integration

Firefox stores its passwords internaly, optionally protected by a master password. KDE has its own password manager called KWallet.
KWallet stores every password in the KDE system, and protects access by a master password. With this extension you are able to use KWallet instead of the default Firefox password manager. It allows tighter integration of Firefox inside KDE.
This extension is compatible with KDE5.X and Firefox > 33.
